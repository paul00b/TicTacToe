# TicTacToe

Project TicTacToe with THP by Paul Broussolle


## Why a gemfile ?
So that's easier to install, and that's funnier to try :D

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tic_tac_toe'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tic_tac_toe

## How to use ?

1. Run the ``First_game.rb`` file to play. Then add the first player, followed but the player 2.
2. Move through the cases by typing the number of the case (from 1 to 9)
4. BEAT HIM
5. <3
